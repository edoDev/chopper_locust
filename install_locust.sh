#   (This allows reuse of a past execution to set everything up)

# General Notes:
# - Our general goal is to get a python3 virtualenv.
# - The more recent python3 we can get, the newer code we can support, and
#   the more features we can take advantage of in our own new code.
# - We need a python3 binary at the system level to have a python3 virtualenv.
# - It doesn't really matter what version of python the system is using to run
#   virtualenv itself, but it has to be a working version of virtualenv.
# - If there is no virtualenv system package, we have to get pip, then use
#   that to install virtualenv. We have *no* other use for system pip.
#   If there is a working virtualenv system package, we can skip pip, since
#   we're only going to use the pip inside the virtualenv anyway.
# - If possible, we really want pip install to grab manylinux binary wheels.
#   This makes it unnecessary to compile anything, faster and less fragile.
# - Many pip packages and some virtualenv packages drag in a gcc build
#   environment. 
#   This isn't necessarily a big problem.
#   If we need pip installs of our app in our virtualenv to build C extensions,
#   this is fine, but we'd probably better add the build deps explicitly.
# - If we didn't install python2 on the system (and why would we), many distro
#   virtualenv packages will require us to speify --python python3 when running
#   virtualenv
